# Homelab & Infrastructure Learning Repository

This repository documents my hands-on learning and experimentation in building, operating, and troubleshooting self-hosted infrastructure.

Primary focus areas:
- Linux system administration
- Virtualization and VM lifecycle management
- Docker-based service deployment
- Networking fundamentals and constraints
- Security hardening and controlled exposure of services

The goal of this repository is not to present a polished production system, but to **demonstrate practical understanding** through:
- real constraints (ISP limitations, single-host setup)
- architectural decisions and trade-offs
- failures, fixes, and lessons learned

## Repository Structure

- `workstation-setup.md` — host machine and tooling baseline  
- `homelab/` — virtual machines, services, and networking experiments  
- `docs/` — architectural notes, decisions, and post-mortems  

Each section is documented incrementally as the lab evolves.
